Great question! You're asking:

Why do we need to do runner = Runner(agent) and then runner.run(...)? Why can't we just do Runner.run(..., agent=agent) like before?

🧠 Short Answer:
Because the latest OpenAI Agents SDK has changed the design to be object-oriented.

The new Runner class is no longer a utility function class with static methods — it's now an instance-based class, which means you must create an object (runner = Runner(...)) before calling .run() on it.

🔍 Deeper Explanation:
Older Versions (Static Method)	Newer Versions (Instance Method)
Runner.run(prompt, agent=agent)	❌ No longer allowed
runner = Runner(agent)
runner.run(prompt)	✅ Required now (object-oriented pattern)

Reason:

In older versions, Runner.run(...) was a class method that accepted agent=... as a keyword.

In newer versions, Runner is a class that stores the agent internally when you instantiate it.

So when you do this:

python
Copy code
runner = Runner(agent)
You're telling the runner: “You will always use this agent.”
Then, when you call runner.run(prompt), the runner already knows what agent to use.

✅ Analogy:
Think of the Runner like a car:

In the old SDK: every time you drive, you had to tell the car which engine to use (Runner.run(..., agent=engine)).

In the new SDK: you build a car with the engine already installed (Runner(agent)), then you just drive it (runner.run(...)).

✅ Final Code (Recap):
python
Copy code
model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106")
agent = Agent(model=model)
runner = Runner(agent)          # You bind the agent once
result = runner.run("your input here")  # Then run the task
print(result)
